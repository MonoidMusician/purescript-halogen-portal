# Contribution

Thank you for contributing to `purescript-halogen-portal`!

Following these guidelines helps ensure I'm able to carefully consider your contribution and help you finalize your pull request. Your time (like mine) is valuable, and I try to at least provide constructive feedback on every contribution.

### Contributions that will get merged 
`purescript-halogen-portal` is an open-source library and I love to receive contributions. There are many ways you can contribute:

* Help expand test coverage
* Help fix open issues, even if that simply means adding a helpful comment
* Help push along open pull requests that need more work to be complete
* Improve or add new usage examples to better demonstrate how to use the library in real-world scenarios
* Update documentation and tutorials to be easier to understand, more comprehensive, and above all -- up to date!

### Contributions we should discuss
Some contributions will take some discussion before I accept an update to the project. If your contribution includes one of the below examples (or seems to be reasonably similar), please consider reaching out to me before putting in a lot of work to build the feature. I'm active on the [PureScript user forum](https://discourse.purescript.org/) and the [functional programming Slack](https://functionalprogramming.slack.com/) community (new? [use this link to join](https://fpchat-invite.herokuapp.com/)!). For feature requests, feel free to open an issue with a tag.

* New features and functions that will change the library's public API
* New tutorials (while I love seeing new tutorials, I may not choose to feature them in the readme)

# Ground Rules

I have a small set of quality-of-life guidelines for contributing to `purescript-halogen-portal`. These include:

* All pull requests must pass continuous integration.
* If you are adding new functionality, you should provide tests and documentation for your code. If you're fixing an existing bug, please provide a failing test case your patch solves.
* If possible, please avoid requiring new dependencies.
* I use `purty` for code formatting, and this should be run on your code. 

### Filing issues
If you have a general question about the project, it's best to ask on the [PureScript user forum](https://discourse.purescript.org/) or the [functional programming Slack](https://functionalprogramming.slack.com/) than to open a new issue. If you have run into a bug in the project, then please do open an issue! When you do, I ask that you follow a few steps which are outlined in our issues template. The gist of it is here:

* Verify the problem is indeed with `purescript-halogen-portal`.
* Record what versions you are using for PureScript, Halogen, and `purescript-halogen-portal`
* Describe the issue with steps to reproduce (as much as you are able). A minimal reproducible example is the absolute best case scenario.

I promise to address the issue as soon as we can.

### Suggesting features or enhancements
I love to hear about ways I could make `purescript-halogen-portal` better. If you're wishing for a feature that doesn't exist, you're probably not alone; there are bound to be others with similar needs. Please feel free to open an issue on GitHub that describes:

* the feature you would like to see
* why you need it
* how it should work

I promise to review your issue, but I'm not always able to accommodate all requests. It helps if you're able to contribute to the implementation, too!

### Code reviews
I look at pull requests weekly, at which point I will review your code, ensure it meets my ground rules and fits with the philosophy of the project, and -- if necessary -- provide constructive feedback. Then, I'll merge your contribution so long as I haven't requested changes or stated that I don't think it's a good fit.

If you opened a pull request and I need to ask a few questions, I expect responses within a month. After that I may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity to keep things manageable.
